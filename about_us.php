<hr />
<p>
    Shiridi Sai Trust is a spiritual and charitable organization dedicated to the teachings and service of <strong>Shiridi Sai Baba</strong>. 
    Established with a vision to promote peace, devotion, and service, the Trust supports a variety of religious, educational, and humanitarian activities.

<p>
    Our mission is to spread the values of <strong>faith, patience, devotion, and compassion</strong> as taught by Sai Baba and to serve the community by offering support in education, health, and spiritual upliftment.

    The Trust actively organizes <strong>Annadanam (food donation)</strong>, health camps, devotional events, educational aid, and support to underprivileged sections of society. We believe that true devotion lies in selfless service.

    Every donation made to the Trust is used with transparency and sincerity to help those in need and to maintain the spiritual activities at the temple. We are grateful to all our devotees and supporters who make this journey possible.
